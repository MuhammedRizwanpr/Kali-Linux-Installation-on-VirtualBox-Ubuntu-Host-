# Kali-Linux-Installation-on-VirtualBox-Ubuntu-Host-
I installed Kali Linux on Ubuntu using VirtualBox by downloading the 3.6 GB official ISO. After creating a VM, I allocated 6 GB storage and set the network to bridged mode. The installation was simple with default settings, and the VM now runs smoothly, ready for security testing and learning.
